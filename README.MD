# MINIMAL BANKING

Minimal banking is a fake web banking made to practice HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

## Technologies involved

- HTML - https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML
- CSS - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS
- Javascript - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript
- Internationalization  - https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl

The design was inspired by this image I found on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16528414-Finance-App).

## To use the app

The app has two current users. You can log in using:
```sh
username: ef | pin: 1111
username: jp | pin 2222
```

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
